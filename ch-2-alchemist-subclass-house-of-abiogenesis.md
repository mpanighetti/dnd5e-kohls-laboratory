# Chapter 2: Alchemist Subclass: [House of Abiogenesis](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-classes/blob/main/third-party/alchemist/house-of-abiogenesis.md)

On most worlds, the chemical and electrical interactions that resulted in the first spark of life is a secret lost to time, but practitioners of abiogenesis alchemy have learned how to reproduce this spark, creating new life from nonliving materials. Alchemists who have perfected this technique can augment their creations with powerful abilities using their potioncraft.

#### Abiogenesis Elixir

Your study of chemistry has granted you knowledge of the secret of abiogenesis, allowing you to grant life to nonliving substances. You learn the **Potion of Life** recipe.

##### [Potion of Life](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-magic-items/blob/main/potions/potion-of-life.md)

_Potion (Alchemist's Potion), Size 1 Transmutation_ (Alchemist (House of Abiogenesis))

- **Materials:** powdered zinc oxide
- **Duration:** varies

_A pale cloud of particles swirls within tiny eddies reverberating through the bottle of clear liquid. The cloud solidifies in your mouth with a slightly chalky texture, and each crunch emits tiny jolts of electricity through your tongue and cheeks. Pairs well with soft cheeses and honeyed desserts._

**Drink (8 Hours).** When you brew this potion, choose the Elemental or Ooze creature type. When a creature drinks this potion, their creature type changes to the type you chose, and they gain 5 Temporary Hit Points.

_Upsizing._ The Temporary Hit Points are increased to five times the potion size.

**Throw (Instantaneous).** When thrown on a Small or Tiny inert nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried, this potion transforms the object into a living creature known as an **Alchemist's Monster**. The object must be either a clockwork device, a corpse, a sample of an element (air, earth, fire, or water) in a container, slime, or any liquid, or the thrown potion has no effect.

The Alchemist's Monster's traits are determined by the nature of the object used in its creation. If more than one selection would be applicable, you choose which one is used at the time of the monster's creation. See the monster's full game statistics in the accompanying **[Alchemist's Monster](#alchemists-monster)** stat block, which includes the **Object Types** table.

The Alchemist's Monster is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. In combat, the monster acts during your turn. It can move and use its Reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a Bonus Action on your turn to command it to take a different action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. You can also sacrifice one of your attacks when you take the Attack action to command the monster to take the Attack action. If you are Incapacitated, the monster can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.

If an Alchemist's Monster is reduced to 0 Hit Points, or if you use a Potion of Life to create a second monster, the current monster immediately reverts to the original inert object used in its creation. Anything the monster was wearing or carrying is left behind when it reverts to its inert form.

_Upsizing._ At size 2 or bigger, you can apply the potion's thrown effect to a Medium-sized object to create a Medium-sized Alchemist's Monster with Strength 17 (+3), and at size 3 or bigger, you can apply its thrown effect to a Large-sized object to create a Large-sized monster with Strength 19 (+4). Additionally, an Alchemist's Monster created by throwing this potion gains increased abilities based on the potion size (as described in its stat block).

#### Level 7: Unnatural Strength

Your Potion of Life grants increased potency to the creatures it creates. An Alchemist's Monster you create has Advantage on Strength-based ability checks and Strength Saving Throws, counts as one size larger when determining its carrying capacity and the weight it can push, drag, or lift, and deals an additional 1d6 alchemical damage per size category above Small on any attack it makes.

#### Level 11: Monstrous Synergy

You have furthered your studies of creating life from nonlife, revealing methods of improving potioncraft imbibed by your creations. An Alchemist's Monster you create can now be under the non-instantaneous effects of two Alchemist's Potions at the same time.

Additionally, when you create an Alchemist's Monster, it optionally gains the drink effect of the Potion of Life based on the potion's size. For the duration, the Potion of Life's Elemental or Ooze creature type is applied as a second creature type in addition to the monster's normal type, instead of replacing it. The monster gains the traits of both of its creature types, and you can command the monster to shift its alchemical damage type between its two options at the start of each of your turns.

#### Level 15: Lifeblood Transfusion

The unnatural creature you have created can tap into its inner bodily reserves to convert itself into a potion as a self-sacrifice. As a Magic action, you can command your Alchemist's Monster to produce an Alchemist's Potion from its body, without spending alchemy points and with the monster's body satisfying any costly or consumed material component requirements. The potion can be any recipe that you are able to brew based on your Alchemist level, and the potion size is the same as the size that was used to create the Alchemist's Monster. Additionally, when a creature drinks this potion, they regain a number of Hit Points equal to the Alchemist's Monster's Hit Points when the new potion was created.

After your Alchemist's Monster creates a potion in this manner, it is immediately reduced to 0 Hit Points, and the object used in its creation is destroyed.

Once you give this command, you regain the ability to do so after you finish a Long Rest.

#### Traits

- _**Alchemical Nature.**_ The Alchemist's Monster is the same size and composition as the object used in its creation. Its creature type, an alchemical damage type that it both resists and deals with its attacks, and additional traits are determined by the nature of the [object](#object-types) used in its creation. If more than one selection would be applicable, you choose which one is used at the time of the monster's creation. A monster of size Medium or larger increases the reach of its Alchemical Strike by 5 ft. for each size category above Small.

  Additionally, the monster can only regain Hit Points by drinking an Alchemist's Potion, by spending Hit Dice, or by finishing a Long Rest. When it drinks an Alchemist's Potion, in addition to the potion's normal effects, it regains 1d6 Hit Points per size of the potion imbibed.

- _**Amorphous (Air/Fire/Water Elemental and Ooze Only).**_ The Alchemist's Monster can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
- _**Siege Monster (Construct and Earth Elemental Only).**_ The Alchemist's Monster deals double damage to objects and structures.
- _**Undead Fortitude (Undead Only).**_ If damage reduces the Alchemist's Monster to 0 Hit Points, it can make a Constitution Saving Throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is Radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the monster drops to 1 Hit Point instead.

#### Actions

- _**Alchemical Strike.** Melee Attack Roll:_ + STR + PB, reach 5 ft.[^👹] _Hit:_ 3 (1d6) Bludgeoning damage + PB alchemical[^👹] damage.

#### Reactions

- _**Intercept (PB/Day).** Trigger:_ An ally that the Alchemist's Monster can see within its reach is hit by an attack. _Response:_ The monster swaps places with the ally (if willing) and becomes the new target of the attack. The original attack roll is compared to the monster's AC, potentially turning the hit into a miss.
